## 🎯 Recommended Learning Path

### Week 1-2: Foundations

```bash
# Read Session 1.1
# Then read Session 1.2 (Domain Layer)
# Then read Session 1.3 (Infrastructure)

# Test your setup
.venv\Scripts\python -c "from llm_engineering.domain.base import NoSQLBaseDocument; print('✓ Setup OK')"
```

### Week 3-5: Data Engineering

```bash
# Read Session 2.1 (Web Crawling)
# Create your first crawler
# Run the ETL pipeline
.venv\Scripts\python -m tools.run --run-etl --no-cache
```

### Week 6-7: Dataset Generation

```bash
# Read Session 3.1 (Instruction Datasets)
# Generate your first dataset
.venv\Scripts\python -m tools.run --run-generate-instruct-datasets --no-cache
```

### Week 8-9: Advanced RAG

```bash
# Read Session 4.1 (Advanced RAG)
# Test the RAG system
.venv\Scripts\python -m tools.rag
```

---

## 🛠️ Quick Commands Reference

### Start Services

```bash
# ZenML Server (if not running)
zenml up --port 8237

# Check ZenML status
.venv\Scripts\zenml status

# View ZenML dashboard
# Open: http://localhost:8237
```

### Run Pipelines

```bash
# List available pipelines
.venv\Scripts\python -m tools.run --help

# Run ETL pipeline
.venv\Scripts\python -m tools.run --run-etl --no-cache

# Run feature engineering
.venv\Scripts\python -m tools.run --run-feature-engineering --no-cache

# Run RAG inference
.venv\Scripts\python -m tools.rag
```

### Access Dashboards

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **ZenML** | http://localhost:8237 | Pipeline monitoring |
| **Qdrant** | http://localhost:6333/dashboard | Vector database |
| **MongoDB** | Use MongoDB Compass | Document database |

## 📖 How to Use the Documentation

### For Beginners

1. **Start with CURRICULUM.md**: Understand the full learning path
2. **Follow Sessions Sequentially**: Each session builds on previous knowledge
3. **Code Along**: Don't just read—write the code yourself
4. **Complete Exercises**: Each session has hands-on tasks
5. **Build Projects**: Apply learning to capstone projects

### For Experienced Developers

1. **Browse README.md**: Find specific topics quickly
2. **Jump to Relevant Sessions**: Focus on what you need
3. **Study Code Examples**: Learn from real implementations
4. **Contribute**: Improve the documentation

---

## 🎓 Session Structure

Each session follows this format:

```markdown
# Session Title

## Learning Objectives
What you'll learn

## Architecture Overview
Visual diagrams and explanations

## Key Files Explained
Deep dive into code with examples

## Hands-On Exercises
Step-by-step coding tasks

## Knowledge Check
Quiz questions to test understanding

## Next Steps
Where to go next
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `zenml login` fails with authorization error

**Solution**: Don't use `zenml login <URL>` for local server. Just run:
```bash
zenml stack set default
```

---

**Issue**: Import errors with transformers

**Solution**: Fix dependency versions:
```bash
uv pip install "tokenizers>=0.22.0,<=0.23.0" --python 3.11
uv pip install "huggingface-hub>=0.34.0,<1.0" --python 3.11
```

---

**Issue**: MongoDB connection fails

**Solution**: Start Docker containers:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
